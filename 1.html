    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Tennis is a <strong><u>racket sport</u></strong> that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).</p><br><img src="tenniscourt.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
    </p><p 
    style="margin-top:45px">The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
